# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction

## Associated with Illinois Institute of Technology, Programming for Data Analytics-ITMD 514

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting passenger satisfaction based on various factors using the Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset sourced from Kaggle. It aims to uncover insights into passenger preferences and experiences during air travel.

### Project Purpose

- Recognize variables and predict passenger satisfaction.
- Investigate the impact of airline services, food, cleanliness, and other factors on passenger satisfaction.
- Determine the average age of passengers based on their gender.
- Understand how one service may be associated with the linearity of another service provided by the airline.

## Dataset

### Dataset Source
- **Dataset Name:** Airline Passenger Satisfaction
- **Source:** Kaggle

### General View of the Data

- **Gender:** Genders given in the data are Male and Female.
- **Age:** There is a wide range of ages among the passengers.
